    <p>Imagine a world where videogames are becoming a universal language between people.</p>

      <p>Worlds where new friendships are made. Where parents enjoy spending time with their kids together.<br>
      Imagine stories that are clever allegories, full of love, kindness, wisdom, and humor.
      Imagine brave and loveable heroes face difficult choices and embrace their greatest fears.
      They grow stronger to accept and respect their enemies for who they are.
      Only to realize they are all brothers and sisters reuniting and awakening their sleeping hearts to each other.
      Singing a song of love and bliss, excitement and curiosity.
      And contemplating the deepest truths about the universe.</p>
      
      <p>
      These are the worlds we're crafting at KittyGiant. Welcome!
